Measuring and Validating Classification Model Quality 
=====================================================

So far, we have looked at model *accuracy* as the measure for assessing the 
extent to which a classification model is valid, but is model accuracy on the test set enough? In this 
lecture, we look at additional measures and techniques for ensuring the quality of a 
classification model. 

By the end of this module, students should be able to:

1. Understand the difference between accuracy, recall, precision and F1-score, and when to use
   each. 
2. Know how to compute these scores, both "by hand" and using sklearn for models that they 
   develop. 

Note that in this lecture we focus on quality measures for classification, as regression requires 
different measures (for example, Mean Squared Error, r2-score; see [1] if you are interested in 
learning about metrics for regression models). 

Limitations of Accuracy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With accuracy, we are simply measuring the proportion of data points we classified correctly. 

.. math:: 

    Accuracy = \frac{Nbr. Correct}{Total}

This has the effect of treating all data points the same, which may not be true. For example, some data points 
might be more important to get right than others. 

Furthermore, accuracy can be a poor measure of a model in cases where the dataset is imbalanced. 

**Example: Spam Email**

For example, we looked at spam email detection in the last unit. Our model tried to determine if an email was 
spam or not. There are four cases, two cases where our model predicts correctly and two cases where it 
does not: 

Correct: 

1. The email was spam, and our model predicted it was spam. 
2. The email was not spam, and our model predicted it was not spam. 

Incorrect:

3. The email was not spam, but our model predicted it was spam. 
4. The email was spam, but our model predicted it was not spam. 

*Discussion:* Of the two incorrect cases, would you say that the one type of error is "worse" than the other or would you say 
they are both equally bad? If this were your email inbox, which would be more annoying for you? 

In many cases, as with virtually all other features and behaviors, this issue comes down to *requirements* for 
the software. It is possible that, given a choice of case 3 or 4, a majority of people would prefer case 4 errors 
to case 3 errors. If an email was actually spam but it was not flagged as such, the worst thing that happens 
is that I have to see the email and delete it. This is the case 4 error. On the other hand, with a case 3 error, 
my email client has filtered an email that was not spam into the spam folder, or even worse, deleted the email 
right away. What if this was an important email? 


**Example: Diabetes Detection** 

The medical field provides another set of examples. Usually (though not always), it is more important to 
avoid missing an illness diagnosis than it is to diagnose an illness that is not there. 

For example, consider a preliminary screening based on an ML model that analyzes 
patient history to determine if they might have diabetes and refers them for follow-up tests. Again,
there are two possible ways the model can fail:

1. The patient has diabetes but the model predicts that they do not. 
2. The patient does not have diabetes but the model predicts that they do. 

*Discussion:* Which of these failure modes is worse? 

Probably case 1 is worse, since the patient could be missing out on life-saving treatment. In case 2, 
the worst thing that might happen is the patient receives additional tests that come back negative, which 
could be inconvenient and monetarily costly but does not risk human life.


**Example: Predicting a Rare Event**

Suppose we wanted to build a ML model to predict whether a high school athlete will go on to win 
an olympic gold medal. Since winning a gold medal at the olympics is an extremely rare event, our 
model would probably score a high accuracy by simply predicting every student to *not* win 
a medal. Even though this would result in a high accuracy, it would typically not achieve the 
desired results. In particular, our model would not be utilizing any learned pattern from prior 
data. 


Recall and Precision
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Recall, Precision and F1-score are three measures designed to help with the above issues. 
To introduce them, we first need to introduce some additional terminology:

* True Positives (TP) -- The number of times the model *correctly* predicted that a sample was 
  in a class. 
* True Negatives (TN) -- The number of times the model *correctly* predicted that a sample was not 
  in a class. 
* False Positives (FP) -- The number of times the model *incorrectly* predicted that a sample was 
  in a class. 
* False Negatives (FN) -- The number of times the model *incorrectly* predicted that a sample was 
  not in a class. 

For example, in the case of spam email: 

* True Positives: Total number of emails the model correctly predicted were spam. 
* True Negatives: Total number of emails the model correctly predicted were not spam. 
* False Positives: Total number of emails the model incorrectly predicted were spam (i.e., 
  the model predicted they were spam but in fact they were not).  
* False Negatives: Total number of emails the model incorrectly predicted were not spam. (i.e., 
  the model predicted they were not spam but in fact they were).

Conceptually, FPs and FNs represent the two kinds of ways our model can be wrong. For certain problems, 
FPs might be worse than FNs and vice versa. For example, with spam email detection, we already observed 
that FPs (falsely detecting an email to be spam) would likely be considered worse than FNs. 

.. note:: 

  The set of values TPs, TNs, FPs and FNs are what we displayed using a confusion matrix at the
  end of the previous module. 

With these terms defined, *recall* is defined as:

.. math:: 

    Recall = \frac{TP}{TP+FN}

We can see from the definition that recall gets worse as the number of false negatives increases, 
but it is not impacted by false positives. 

Similarly, *precision* is defined as:

.. math:: 

    Precision = \frac{TP}{TP+FP}

We can see from the definition that precision gets worse as the number of false positives increases, 
but it is not impacted by false negatives. 

.. note:: 

    Observe that :math:`0 \leq precision, recall \leq 1` and that both precision and recall 
    are optimal when they have a value of 1. 

*Discussion:* Given these definitions, which do you think is more important in the following cases:

* Spam email detection?
* Diabetes detection? 

For spam email, it would likely be more important to improve precision (i.e. reduce FPs) because falsely 
labeling an email as spam is worse than falsely labeling an email as not spam. 

For the diabetes example, it would likely be more important to improve recall (i.e., reduce FNs) because 
not diagnosing someone with diabetes is likely more detrimental than diagnosing someone as having 
diabetes that does not. 

Note also that, without improving the overall accuracy of a model, if a model's recall improves then its
precision necessarily gets worse and vice versa. 

:math:`F1`-score
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :math:`F_1`-score (or just, *F*-score for short) is the *harmonic mean* of the precision and recall, 
that is, a certain kind of average, and is thus given by the following formula: 

.. math:: 

    F_1 = \frac{2}{precision^{-1} + recall^{-1}}

Note that since precision and recall are both fractions less than 1, their inverses are bigger than 1. The 
worse the precision or recall (i.e., the smaller the value), the larger their inverses and therefore the 
worse the :math:`F_1` score. 

Note also that the :math:`F_1` score values precision and recall equally: increasing or decreasing 
either precision or recall has the same ultimate effect on the :math:`F_1` score. Therefore, the 
:math:`F_1`  score does not favor true positives or true negatives nor penalize more false positives 
or false negatives.

When would it be appropriate to use *F*-score for a model? Since *F*-score averages precision and 
recall, it can be a good choice in cases where accuracy would be misleading -- e.g., with an imbalanced
data set -- but there is no preference for precision or recall. Predicting a "rare" event, such as 
which student athlete will go onto win the olympic gold medal might be one such example. 


Computing Recall, Precision and :math:`F_1` with ``sklearn``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The sklearn package has convenience functions for computing recall, precision and :math`F_1` score
within the ``sklearn.metrics`` module. Each of these functions provides the same, simple API taking 
two arguments: the actual values and the predicted values. 

Let's compute these for the Spambase linear classifier we created last time. 

.. code-block:: python3 

    >>> from sklearn.metrics import recall_score, precision_score, f1_score

    >>> recall_test = recall_score(y_test, clf.predict(X_test))
    >>> recall_train = recall_score(y_train, clf.predict(X_train))

    >>> precision_test = precision_score(y_test, clf.predict(X_test))
    >>> precision_train = precision_score(y_train, clf.predict(X_train))

    >>> f1_test = f1_score(y_test, clf.predict(X_test))
    >>> f1_train = f1_score(y_train, clf.predict(X_train))

    >>> print(f"recall score on test: {recall_test}, recall score on train: {recall_train}")
    >>> print(f"precision score on test: {precision_test}, precision score on train: {precision_train}")
    >>> print(f"f1_score on test: {f1_test}, f1 score on train: {f1_train}")

    recall score on test: 0.7301587301587301, recall score on train: 0.7004255319148937
    precision score on test: 0.7063339731285988, precision score on train: 0.6718367346938775
    f1_score on test: 0.7180487804878047, f1 score on train: 0.6858333333333333


We see that precision is worse than accuracy recall for our spam detector, at 70.6% on the 
test dataset as compared to 73%. This agrees with our confusion matrix where we saw that 
there were more false positives than false negatives. 


Why Does :math:`F_1` Use the Harmonic Mean and Not the Arithmetic Mean?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This good question was raised by a student in class, so we wanted to try and provide some 
intuition. The idea behind :math:`F_1` is to provide a metric that: 

* Is close to the precision and recall scores when they are close to each other in value. 
* Will be close to the lower value of precision and recall whenever they are far apart. 

This will be useful for imbalanced datasets.
We can look at a specific example to make things concrete. 

Suppose we have dataset with 100 samples and a "rare" class where only 5 samples are in the class 
(so, 95 samples are not in the class). Let's further suppose we have a model that makes a 50-50 
guess as to whether the sample is in the class. Even in the best possible case, this model will 
get all 5 samples correct and 45 samples wrong. Therefore, the TP, FP, and FN will be:

* TP = 5 
* FP = 45 
* FN = 0

Thus, we have these values for precision and recall: 

* Recall = 5/5 = 1.0
* Precision = 5/(5+45) = 5/50 = 0.1

These numbers are very different from each other, and intuitively we would probably think 
of this model as a poor performer (it just makes a 50/50 guess). However, let's look at the 
scores: 

* Accuracy = 55/100 = .55 
* Arithmetic Mean of Precision and Recall = (1 + 0.1)/2 = 0.55 
* :math:`F_1` score (harmonic mean) = :math:`2/(1 + (0.1)^{-1}) = 2/11 = 0.18`
