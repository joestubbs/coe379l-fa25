Remarks
-------
* The key distinction between supervised and unsupervised learning is whether one has labeled datasets. 
  Many people got perfect scores on Problem 1, but some reversed "supervised" and "unsupervised"

* Imputation is a technique for handling missing data within a dataset. It involves not discarding 
  data (the opposite), and in general, we don't want to discard data whenever possible. 

* Some people got confused about the definition and/or mathematical notation associated with the perceptron.
