Exam Study Guide 
================

The exam will cover Unit 1, Unit 2 and Unit 3 up to and including the basics of 
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and dense (Fully-connected) networks. It will 
not include CNNs or any other material after. 

There are two sections to the guide: a general "exam preparation" section, and a 
"sample exam questions" section. The preparation section is intended to be comprehensive 
and give you a guide for the kinds of topics you should understand. The example 
questions section is intended to give you a flavor of the kinds of questions 
you are likely to see on the exam. Note that the examples do not constitute 
a comprehensive set of questions. 


General Exam Preparation 
------------------------

Unit 1
^^^^^^
* Explain the difference between a Pandas Series and a DataFrame. To load data 
  from a CSV file, which would you use? What does the Pandas Dataframe correspond 
  to with respect to the CSV file? What does the Series correspond to? 
* Describe some of the sources for outliers in data. In which cases should outliers 
  be discarded from the dataset, and in which cases should they be included? 
* When do you need to use imputation on a dataset? What is imputation and 
  what is the difference between univariate and multivariate imputation?
* Describe some examples of univariate imputation and some examples of multivariate 
  imputation. What ``numpy`` functions might be used in an implementation? 
* What does the ``groupby`` function do in Pandas? How would you use ``groupby`` 
  to implement a univariate imputation? 

Unit 2
^^^^^^
* Describe the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning. Under which 
  scenarios would you use one versus the other? What are the main advantages and 
  disadvantages of each? Given specific scenarios and datasets, make sure you can 
  identify which should be used.
* What is the difference between classification and regression? Given specific 
  scenarios and datasets, make sure you can identify which should be used.
* How would you identify a linearly separable dataset from a pictorial example? 
  If a dataset is linearly separable, what guarantees could you make? 
* How is a decision function used in a machine learning model? Is it used in classification, 
  regression or both? 
* What is the difference between accuracy, recall, precision, and F-1? Make sure you can 
  identify which metric is most important for a given scenario and be able to justify 
  your answer.  in each of the following examples? Given specific scenarios and datasets, make sure you can identify which should be used and be able to explain your answer. 
* Describe the two primary methods we have discussed in class to optimize different 
  classification metrics. Be sure you are able to answer questions about how to 
* What is the meaning of the “k” in the K-nearest neighbor algorithm? What is a hyperparameter in a machine learning model? What standard method do we use to determine the optimal values of hyperparameters?
* Describe the advantages and disadvantages of K-nearest neighbor versus Linear 
  Classification.
* As the value of “k” in the K-nearest neighbor algorithm increases, how does the model’s 
  sensitivity to outliers change? 
* What is the definition of a hypyerparameter? Describe some example of hypyerparameters in the 
  models we have studied, and know about the ways in which their values can impact the model's 
  performance. 
* Describe cross validation and what it is used for. 
* Describe advantages and disadvantages of the Decision Tree algorithm. How does it 
  compare with Linear Classification? KNN? 
* What is the relationship between Decision Trees and Random Forests? What is the 
  advantage of Random Forests compared to Decision Trees? What is the disadvantage? 
* To what extent is Random Forest an example of an ensemble method? What are other examples 
  of ensemble methods? 

Unit 3 
^^^^^^
* What is the mathematical definition of a perceptron? How do the weights, biases, 
  and activation function factor into the definition?
* What is the role of the activation function in an ANN? 
* What are the advantages of ANNs over the methods we have discussed in Unit 2? 
  What are some of the disadvantages? 
* For a fully connected ANN, how do the input dimensions of layer depends on the 
  output dimension of other layers? 
* How does the input dataset put constraints on the architecture of the ANN? 
  Which layer(s) are constrained? And which parts of the layer(s)? 
* For a classification problem, what are the constraints on dimension on an ANN?
