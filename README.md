# COE 379L Fall 2025 Lecture Materials

Course materials for the Fall 2025 instance of COE 379L: Software Design for Responsible Intelligent Systems, 
UT Austin.

## Building Locally

We are using Nix for the local build. Note that the requirements.txt file is included only for the ReadTheDocs build.

To run the doc engine locally, first enter the Nix development environment

```
$ nix develop -i 
```

We recommend the `-i` so that environment variables set in the outside shell don't interfere. 
In particular, this can prevent issues with locale errors, etc.
